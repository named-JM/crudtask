<h1>Delete Verification using PHP Mailer and OTP</h1>
<p>This comes with PHP Mailer Library and composer! I also designed simply of the email look.<br></p>
<p>Here in the gmail, I deleted a nonexistent email so I had to see the one who sent which is fake email and see the verification code to delete it.</p>
